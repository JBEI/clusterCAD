BGC0000014.1 # excluded because it has an irregular DH that also acts as a cyclase
BGC0000080.1 # excluded because it has an irregular DH that also acts as a cyclase
BGC0001288.1 # excluded because the first module is inactive
BGC0000976.1 # excluded because it has an atypical non-AT start as well as several other biosynthetic irregularities
BGC0000029.1 # excluded because it has significant deviations from canonical PKS logic that are unsupported by ClusterCAD
BGC0000982.1 # excluded because it is a PKS-NRPS hybrid that has the NRPS as module 1 after a PKS loading domain with later modules returning to PKS modules
BGC0000143.1 # excluded because antiSMASH does not pick up all modules in the pathway and the pathway appears poorly characterized
BGC0000051.1 # excluded because a subunit is missing in the middle of the pathway
BGC0000097.1 # excluded because it has on-line tailoring that is not compatible with ClusterCAD
